                        <p class="mb-4">Surrey is one of BC's fastest-growing cities, and with growth comes an
                            increasing need for professional security services. Whether you're looking for a stable
                            career or a stepping stone into law enforcement, getting your BC Security License is the
                            first step.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-dark fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">1. Unprecedented Job Stability</h3>
                        <p>Unlike many industries that face seasonal dips, the security sector remains vital year-round.
                            From retail centers like Central City to corporate headquarters and construction sites, the
                            demand is constant.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-dark fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">2. Diverse Working Environments</h3>
                        <p>Security isn't just about standing at a gate. In Surrey, you can find roles in mobile patrol,
                            loss prevention, event security, and high-tech monitoring centers. There's a niche for every
                            personality type.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-dark fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">3. Clear Career Progression</h3>
                        <p>Starting as a security guard often leads to roles like Site Supervisor, Account Manager, or
                            Security Consultant. Many of our clients use security experience to strengthen their
                            applications for the RCMP or local police departments.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-dark fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">4. Flexible Scheduling</h3>
                        <p>Most security companies offer varied shifts—days, afternoons, and overnights. This makes it
                            an ideal choice for students or those looking for part-time work alongside other
                            commitments.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-dark fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">5. Skill Development</h3>
                        <p>You'll gain invaluable skills in conflict resolution, emergency response, and observational
                            techniques. These are highly transferable skills that every employer values.</p>
